1.Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role

I did this by loging in to my root user and then I deleted all my security acess keys.
I changed my root password to a temporary password just in case I need it later on.
I created an IAM role, loggged on into the AWS Management Console with administrative IAM credentials. I later accessed the IAM dashboard and select "Roles" from the navigation pane. I clicked on "Create role" and choose the trusted entity type, which could be another AWS account for cross-account access or the same account for internal roles. I Attach appropriate permissions policies that define the role's actions in my case I created "Administrative access".I assigned a name by EMK.
